# Error Codes in C++ 11

This project implements error codes in C++ 11 as an exercise. 


## Error Detection and Correction

Error codes are coding algorithms that ensure data integrity. In most
error codes, additional bits of information are added to a data payload,
so that the original message can be reconstructed out of the encoded message
even if there are some corruption in the post-encoded message.
